				<h1>Pixel Plane</h1>
				<p>Pixel Plane is a side-scroller built on SpriteKit where the aim of the game is to fly as long as possible without passenger comfort falling below a certain level. The project took me around 3 months and was released in 2016. Pixel Plane received over 3.5k downloads during its time on the App Store and won me a scholarship to attend Apples Wordwide Developers Conference in 2016.
